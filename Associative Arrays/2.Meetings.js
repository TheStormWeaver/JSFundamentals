Write a function that manages meeting appointments. The input comes as an array of strings. Each string contains a
weekday and personâ€™s name. For each successful meeting, print a message. If you receive the same weekday twice,
the meeting cannot be scheduled so print a conflict message. At the end print a list of all successful meetings. See
example for message format and details.
